<h3 class="heading-small">Changes made</h3>

<p>
  In this prototype switches out the 'when was the last manual payment made' 
  screen, and instead just asks the agent to confirm that they have made the 
  manual payments to date. This was to test a far more simple process, and also 
  to make the build less complex.
