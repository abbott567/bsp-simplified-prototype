<h3 class="heading-small">Changes made</h3>

<p>
  In this prototype switches out the 'when do you want the schedule to 
  start' screen for a the 'when was the last manual payment made' screen. 
  This was to test whether it made more sense to the agent to say what 
  they did last than to work out when the system needed to take over.
