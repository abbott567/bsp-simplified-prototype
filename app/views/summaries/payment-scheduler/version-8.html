<h3 class="heading-small">Changes made</h3>

<p>
  Changed the content asking the agent if they have made all of the clerical 
  payments to date. Changed from a Yes only style declaration to a Yes / No 
  question to see if it was easier to understand what to do if all the payments 
  aren't up to date.
