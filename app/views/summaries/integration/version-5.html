<p>
  Agents could change the rate from the claim details tab or the payment 
  schedule tab, in this instance 2 agents changed in the claim details tab and 
  3 in the payment schedule tab. Although agents were quite confident with 
  how to change the rate, they werenâ€™t sure if the change had been actioned 
  from their actions. Agents were using the payment schedule to confirm if 
  their actions had caused a change as this was the only option available to 
  them as they felt like there may have been something else to do to complete 
  their interaction.
