<h2 class="heading-medium">RVU Referral</h2>

<p>
  In this iteration we are looking at changing the design for capturing what the 
  outcome was in an RVU referral.
</p>

<h3 class="heading-small">Research notes</h3>
<p>
  CHB backdating - claim being paid at the standard rate, CHB has been backdated 
  but not enough to cover the initial payment and two of the first monthly payments. 
</p>

<p>
  GB agents wonâ€™t refer a case to the RVU until they have received a marriage 
  cert and a 194/195 to gather enough information for the RVU investigation. 
  This was an oversight within the current process. We need to look to test this 
  example in the next round of research. 
</p>

<p>
  This design worked much better for agents, there were no doubts about the 
  outcome of the RVU decision and how to record this. 
</p>

<p>
  The partial backdating worked well, however not all agents checked the payment 
  schedule before uprating the payments. The ones that did check the payment 
  schedule had already worked out what the claimant should be entitled to based 
  on the backdating rules. Agents were surprised but pleased that the effective 
  date was being used to calculate the backdated payments so that manual 
  intervention was not required. There were some comments around knowing which 
  payments had been uprated for the purposes of creating the decision letter. 
  This should be included in the next round of testing so that agents can work 
  through the end to end process.
