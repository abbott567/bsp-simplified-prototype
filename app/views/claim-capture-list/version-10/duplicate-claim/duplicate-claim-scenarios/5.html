  {{d.claimant.fullName}} has already tried to claim Bereavement Support Payment for 
  {{d.partner.fullName}}
</h1>

<p>
  Their previous claim was disallowed because they did not send in proof of their 
  marriage or civil partnership.
</p>

<p>
  Because they have not had a claim allowed yet, you can still start a new one. 
  But you may need to check it is not the same claim form as last time.
